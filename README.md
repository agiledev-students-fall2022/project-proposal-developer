### Project title

Scheduled For Success

### What and why?

I would like to build a mobile application.  In particular, I would like to build a scheduling app because keeping to daily tasks can be very difficult, but is a vital part of people's lives, and therefore a scheduling application can be very helpful and used by a wide range of users, as well as frequently.  The system would allow users to input daily events, notifying users when they fall off track of their schedules.  Life can get hectic and being able to keep to a schedule and manage one's time can be extremely difficult.  Therefore, this application would help serve as a remedy to such stress by offering a helpful schedule tracker to users.  Being able to reduce such a common issue is important, since sticking to a schedule and being able to manage one's time is vital for success and a balanced life.  

### For whom?

This software is intended to be for students like me who have a hard time managing their time and keeping an organized schedule.  However, it is not limited to students, but rather anyone who needs a little help in keeping to a schedule could use it.  

### How?

The system will allow users to add events and tasks to the appropriate days.  The system would also allow the user to edit the events (the time in which they occur, delete the event, check off if the event was completed, add additional details, change the icons which best represent the event, and much more).  As well, the system will allow other customization features such as changing the color theme of the application, the font, and background. Finally, the system will send the user reminders before a scheduled event as a way to keep users on track.


### Scope

The proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious as the application is very straightforward in terms of functionality, however there are many fine details that need to be taken care of.  In particular, the visual aspects of the application must be very organized and easy to navigate, as users would be expected to use this application daily, so a lot of front-end work would need to be done.  In addition, users would be expected to register their information or login into the application so that their tasks could be saved, and so working with user data will be a large back-end task.  As well, due to the high usage of data being inputted into the scheduling application, finding a good way to store this data would be vital.  In addition, there will be many customization features that will need to be implemented.  Therefore, although the functionality of the application is simple, there are many small yet vital details that must be implemented.
